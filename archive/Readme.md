This directory contains earlier prototypes.

* 1.vm.arc: an early prototype of a statement-oriented interpreted language
  built in Arc. Now has its own repo at
  [mu0](https://github.com/akkartik/mu0).

* 2.vm: a statement-oriented interpreted language. Now has its own repo at
  [mu1](https://github.com/akkartik/mu1).

  register allocation.
