//: Dependencies:
//: - We'd like to compute segment addresses before setting up global variables,
//:   because computing addresses for global variables requires knowing where
//:   the data segment starts.
//: - We'd like to finish expanding labels before computing segment addresses,
//:   because it would make computing the sizes of segments more self-contained
//:   (num_bytes).
//:
//: Decision: compute segment addresses before expanding labels, by being
//: aware in this layer of certain operand types that will eventually occupy
//: multiple bytes.
//:
//: The layer to expand labels later hooks into num_bytes() to teach this
//: layer that labels occupy zero space in the binary.
