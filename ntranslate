# Translate SubX by running the self-hosted translator natively on Linux.
#
# Possible knobs:
#   Whether to run a phase natively or in emulated mode.
#     This script is for running natively.
#   Whether to stop after a phase.
#     This script assumes inputs are already working so doesn't easily show
#     which phase an error happens in.
#   Whether to trace a phase. Whether to always trace or rerun with tracing
#   enabled after an error.
#     Leave tracing to other scripts. We save intermediate files so it's easy
#     to rerun a single phase afterwards.
#   Whether to run a phase with debug information. (Need to juggle multiple
#   sets of debug files.)
#     Again, that's for subsequent scripts.
