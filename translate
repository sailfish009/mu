# Translate SubX by running the self-hosted translator in emulated mode on
# Linux or BSD or Mac.
#
# Possible knobs:
#   Whether to run a phase natively or in emulated mode.
#     Just always emulate for now since we debug on non-Linux.
#   Whether to stop after a phase.
#     Just always run all phases, but print out phases so it's clear where an
#     error happens.
#   Whether to trace a phase. Whether to always trace or rerun with tracing
#   enabled after an error.
#     Leave tracing to other scripts. We save intermediate files so it's easy
#     to rerun a single phase afterwards.
#   Whether to run a phase with debug information. (Need to juggle multiple
#   sets of debug files.)
#     Again, that's for subsequent scripts.
